Mushroom Madness!!!!

High Concept: This is a 2D platformer with 3D environments. You play as a mushroom. The only goal for you is to plant one of your spores
in end area. You must get around the different obstacles, and beat a boss at the end of each level. The player can also plant mushrooms
as checkpoints, thus allowing player to restart at checkpoint. There are 3 level. Have fun!

Art: This will either be hand-drawn with modifications in photoshop, or pixel art.

Coding: I will be using the starting player controller for prototyping, as well as standard camera controlls. However I plan to write the
other scripts myself.

Mechanics I want:

	-Basic movement
	-Player bash attack
	X-Falling branches 
	-Player health
	-Boss ai
	-Spikes
	X-Checkpoints
	-More to come...
